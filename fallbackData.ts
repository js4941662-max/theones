    text: `This is a fascinating take on AI's role in development productivity. Your point about AI handling boilerplate code really hits home.

I recently experienced this on a project where we used a code assistant to generate unit tests and data models. It cut our initial setup time by nearly 40%, freeing up the team to focus on complex business logic and system architectureâ€”the parts of the job that require deep human expertise. The tool didn't replace our engineers; it amplified their capabilities.

It's less about human vs. machine and more about a human-machine partnership.

Have you found certain types of development tasks benefit more from this AI partnership than others?`,

This shift allowed our senior developers to dedicate their time to architectural decisions and mentoring junior engineers, an ROI that's harder to quantify but incredibly valuable. It's less about human vs. machine and more about a human-machine partnership. Have you found certain types of development tasks benefit more from this AI partnership than others, for example, frontend UI generation versus backend algorithm optimization?",
